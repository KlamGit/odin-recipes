    <p>There's not going to be any heading for this. At least for now. I wouldn't know how. It's a recipe but also a personal experience. Last Christmas we were in Berlin, me and my partner, instead of the usual tradition of going to this nice village named Battin in Uckermark, Brandenburg where my mother-in-law usually hosts the rest of the family. I did as much as I could to bring some festive colours in our diet...which honestly isn't saying much. Anyway..I had made pot roast before, and my partner seemed to like it, so that's what I did. Pot roast with grilled broccoli and mushrooms, sauteed peas and the famous German Knödel or Kloß. The Knödel was store bought by the way, I just had to give them shapes and boil. 
    </p>
    <p>A vague idea of a recipe..</p>
    <p>Pot Roast Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 kg beef chuck roast (shoulder cut)</li>
        <li>1 cup water mixed with beef bouillon</li>
        <li>250 ml red wine, or more if you like</li>
        <li>1 whole head of garlic</li>
        <li>1 or 2 carrorts, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>Quarter wedge of celery, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 or 2 large onions, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 or 2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 or 2 sprigs of rosemary</li>
        <li>1 or 2 sprigs of thyme</li>
        <li>1 or 2 sprigs of parsley</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Oil for searing</li>
        <li>A little apple cider vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chuck roast really well on all sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>In a large pan (or like I like to do in the roasting pan) heat some oil, and sear the roast on all sides in high heat and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, saute the onions, carrots, and celery until they're soft.</li>
        <li>Add garlic to the pan for a few seconds. Make sure it doesn't burn.</li>
        <li>Put the roast back in the pan, add the bay leaves, rosemary, thyme, and parsley.</li>
        <li>Pour the water and beef bouillon mixture and the red wine in the pan.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan and let it simmer in the oven at 150°C 3-4 hours, or until the meat is tender.</li>
        <li>Remove the meat from the pan and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing.</li>
        <li>In a small pan melt some butter and add flour. Stir for a couple minutes together.</li>
        <li>Strain the sauce into the small pan with the butter and flour mixture. Incorporate everything well together until the sauce is smooth and velvety.</li>
        <li>Season the sauce with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Serve the meat with the sauce and the sides.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
