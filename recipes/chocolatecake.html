    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chocolate Cake, as the name suggests, is a cake using Chocolate and cocoa. I made this cake for my mother-in-law's birthday, who turned 60 this year! While I always turn to Laura in the Kitchen's Laura Vitale for inspirations and recipes - and this has not been an exception - I stumbled onto the youtube channel of Anna Wilson, who's apparently an accomplished American professional baker, who also happened to have a great chocolate cake recipe on her channel. Both recipes were quite similar, except Anna's Fudge Frosting called for some sour cream in it, which is the only major change from that of Laura that I can remember.</p>
    <p>Anywho....here's the recipe.</p>
    <p>Cake Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>12 tbsp all purpose flour</li>
        <li>20 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>8 tbsp Dutch process cocoa powder</li>
        <li>¾ tsp Baking soda</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>115 gm Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>8 tbsp hot, strong brewed coffee</li>
        <li>8 tbsp whole milk</li>
        <li>2 large egg</li>
        <li>1 sachet vanilla sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Fudge Frosting Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>340 gram 52% semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups (425 ml) heavy cream</li>
        <li>½ cup (125 ml) sour cream</li>
        <li>1 sachet vanilla sugar</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>25 gram butter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>For the ganache:</li>
        <li>Add some water in a saucepan and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Add heavy cream and bittersweet chocolate in a bowl and put the bowl on top of the steaming saucepan, gently stirring. </li>
        <li>Add sourcream and butter in it, incorporating everything well together. Then set it aside. </li>
        <li>For the cake:</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 175°C. Grease and line a 26cm round cake pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Cream together butter and sugar in a mixing bowl until well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs and vanilla, and mix well.</li>
        <li>Sift the dry ingredients in a large bowl and then pour over the wet mixture. Mix well. (or sift them on the same bowl, I would)</li>
        <li>Add rest of the wet ingredients - coffee and milk - to the cake mixture, and mix everything well.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 50-65 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove from the pan and let it cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Once the cake is completely cool, cut it in half horizontally and spread some of the ganache on the bottom layer. Place the top layer on top and spread the rest of the ganache on top and sides of the cake.</li>
        <li>Dig in!</li>  
    </ol>
